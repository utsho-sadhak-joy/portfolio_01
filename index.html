            Programming is the process of creating a set of 
            instructions that tell a computer how to perform
            a task. Programming can be done using a variety
            of computer programming languages, such as 
            JavaScript, Python, and C++. I like programming.
            Last 2 years i am continuously working on programming.
            Mainly i worked with javascript but i know other programming knowledge.
            Such as python, java, c, ruby and so on . . .

                Software engineering is a branch of computer science
                 that includes the development and building of computer
                  systems software and applications software. Computer
                   systems software is composed of programs that include
                    computing utilities and operations systems. 
                    Applications software consists of user-focused programs
                     that include web browsers, database programs, etc.

                    Software engineers have extensive knowledge of programming
                     languages,software development, and computer operating 
                     systems, and they apply engineering principles to software creation.

                Is JavaScript easy to learn:
                JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn
                programming language as compared to other
                languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python.
                It is a high-level, interpreted language 
                that can easily be embedded with languages
                like HTML. It was developed by Netscape 
                Communications Corporation, Mozilla Foundation,
                and ECMA International
